                <lb/>their having provided for me, the best and most 
                <lb/>carful education.        
                <lb/>Nothing remarkable occurred to me in my youth-

                <lb/>by
                
            <pb n="1002; page 2"/>
                
                <lb/>by way of <placeName type="region">Sweden</placeName>, to <placeName type="settlement">Barby</placeName>, where we arrived on the
                <lb/><date when="1759-07-05"><date when="1759-07-05">5 July</date></date> the same year. On the <date when="1759-12-26"><date when="1759-12-26">26 Dec.</date></date> I was received
                <lb/>into the church, &amp; on the <date when="1760-09-30"><date when="1760-09-30">30 Sept. 1760</date></date> partook with
                <lb/>the same for the first time of the holy sacrament.
                <lb/>During this period, from the year <date from="1748" to="1760"><date from="1748" to="1760">1748 till 1760</date></date>,
                <lb/>I made various experiences, <del>whi</del>concerning which I could
                <lb/>say much to the praise &amp; glory of our dear Lord. I was 
                <lb/>at various times under severe temptations from unbelief,
                <lb/>from which I was most mercifully delivered by the
                <lb/>perseverance of my soul. The good providence of God,
                <lb/>in various cases, evidently watched over me, to preserve
                <lb/>me from instant death. Once I fell into a large kettle
                <lb/>of boiling water; &amp; another time into a cistern of cold 
                <lb/>water. On acertain occasion, a person in a most violent
                <lb/>rage, threw a short-pointed knife at my uncle; it
                <lb/>missed him, but struck &amp; almost killed me. In my
                <lb/>19th year I was thrown from a horse, &amp; the circumstan-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>ces were such, that it was a wonder to every one
                <lb/>that my life had been preserved. For every such
                <lb/>deliverance that is known <del type="add">or shall be</del> to me, my songs of 
                <lb/>praise shall be raised before the throne of the
                <lb/>Lamb.
                <lb/>My heart remained during all this time,
                <lb/>amidst innumerable changes, under a great preserve,
                <lb/>though
                
            <pb n="1002; page 3"/>
                
                <lb/>though the reading of the four Evangelists, &amp; particularly
                <lb/>the history of the sufferings of our Saviour, caused me
                <lb/>many serious reflections. Once on retiring to sleep, after
                <lb/>meditating much on the subject, our Lord in his suffering,
                <lb/>was presented to my mind in a dream, in the most
                <lb/>lively manner. This occasioned, for a short time after-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>wards, a happy feeling in my heart; but I was soon
                <lb/>after conscious, that I was still as unconverted, and
                <lb/>full of unbelief, as ever I had been before. Our Saviour
                <lb/>at length revealed himself to me as the Reconciler of
                <lb/>my soul, &amp; bestowed upon me that grace which makes
                <lb/>me happy, &amp; will continue to be my happiness till 
                <lb/>I shall see him face to face.
                <lb/>In <placeName type="settlement">Barby</placeName> I studied divinity &amp; medicine. In the
                <lb/>latter I practiced with good success till I resolved
                <lb/>to devote myself to the service of our dear Lord,
                <lb/>to be used in the ministry of the gospel as he might
                <lb/>think proper, without making any particular plan for 
                <lb/>myself, &amp; only having this principle in view, that he
                <lb/>might be with me in every thing.
                <lb/>In <date when="1765-09">Sept. 1765</date> I received my first call in the
                <lb/>service of the <orgName>Brns. Church</orgName>, as a teacher in the <orgName><name type="role">Pedago-

                <lb/>after a prosperous journey both by land and sea. Here
                <lb/>I am at the time of writing this, in expectation whether
                <lb/>my dear Lord will soon permit me to rest from my
                <lb/>labors, or strengthen me anew for his service.
                <lb/>I need not here notice, that I have purposely
                <lb/>omitted the mention of many particular occurrences 
                <lb/>in which I have <add>been</add> concerned in so many different places.
                <lb/>When I reflect on them all, I adore my gracious

                <lb/>for his patience, for his constant forgiveness, and
                <lb/>for his mere than tender love, with which he has

                <lb/> So far his own account
                <lb/>His widow adds as follows:
                <lb/>On the <date when="1810-12-29">29 Decbr. 1810</date> my dear husband was called
                <lb/>by the <orgName>Unity’s Elders Conference</orgName> from his offices here,
                <lb/>&amp; to return to <placeName type="continent">Europe</placeName>. He had for some time before,

            <pb n="1004; page 6"/>
                
                <lb/>found his official duties to press too hard upon his<del>m</del>
                <lb/><del>mind</del>; as ever since his arrival in this country, his
                <lb/>strength had been declining. In <date when="1811-05">May</date> following we
                <lb/>travelled with B: <persName>V. h. Van Vleckto Litiz</persName>, where, by com-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>mission from the <orgName>Unity’s Elders Conference</orgName>, with the
                <lb/>assistance of B: <persName>Charles Gotthold Reichel</persName>, he consecrated
                <lb/>B: <persName>John Herbst</persName> to be a bishop of the <orgName>Brethren’s church</orgName>.
                <lb/>This solemn transaction was accompanied with the
                <lb/>particular power &amp; grace of our Lord. On our return
                <lb/>to <placeName type="settlement">Bethlehem</placeName>, he resigned his offices of president of
                <lb/>the <orgName>Genl. Helps. Confe.</orgName> for the <placeName type="region">Pennsylvania</placeName> &amp; adjacent 
                <lb/>congns., &amp; cong(?). helper &amp; minister in <placeName type="settlement">Bethlehem</placeName>, to B: <persName>Chals.
                <lb/>Gotthold Reichel</persName>. He found his infirmities now fast 
                <lb/>increasing; his leg in particular evere afflicted with
                <lb/>sores, &amp; he was during the following winter entirely
                <lb/>confined to the house. On the <date when="1813-06-02">2 June 1813</date>, he was 
                <lb/>seized with a violent fever, which for a time depri-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>ved him of speech, &amp; tended much to debilitate his 
                <lb/>constitution. His pains in different parts of his
                <lb/>body evere now often excessive, &amp; called forth the
                <lb/>tears of sympathy of those who visited him. He
                <lb/>remained uniformly friendly &amp; affectionate to every
                <lb/>one, only he was sorry that speaking was difficult to
                <lb/>him. He was never impatient, even after sleepless 
                <lb/>nights
                
            <pb n="1004; page 7"/>

                <lb/>nights; but constantly expressed thankfulness to our
                <lb/>Lord for his gracious assistance, &amp; precious nearness,
                <lb/>through which he said all his afflictions were lightened.
                <lb/>He used often to say: “How graciously does our dear
                <lb/>“Saviour deal with me!”
                <lb/>In <date when="1813-09">Septr.</date> a pain in his side made it difficult
                <lb/>for him to lie in bed, &amp; his faculties suffered through
                <lb/>severe head-ache. During the last month of his life
                <lb/>he suffered extremely, especially through a sore on his
                <lb/>back. But his patience continued uninterrupted,
                <lb/>and he comforted himself with the thought, that all
                <lb/>the troubles of this life would soon be changed for 
                <lb/>unutterable joys, when he should see &amp; be with his
                <lb/>Saviour for ever. He had for many years earnestly
                <lb/>desired after this happiness, and was never tired
                <lb/>of meditating on the subject, what that implied:
                <lb/>“to have the living hope, after having run the race
                <lb/>“of faith, to see his Saviour as He is.” It was parti-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>cularly pleasing to him, that brethren &amp; sisters often
                <lb/>sung verses in his chamber, accompanied with music;
                <lb/>those hymns were most agreeable &amp; interesting to him,
                <lb/>which treat of our departure to the Lord, and of the
                <lb/>church made perfect. On the <date when="1814-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, as his weakness
                <lb/>had for many some days much encreased, it was
                <lb rend="indent"/>observed

                <lb/>evident that the time of his departure was very near,
                <lb/>the ble[s]sing of the Lord and the church was imparted
                <lb/>to him, during a particular sense of the divine presence, 
                <lb/>and our fellowship with the church triumphant. 
                <lb/>Soon after, he fell softly asleep, &amp; his dear redeemed
                <lb/>soul went into the arms of his Redeemer.
                <lb rend="indent"/>I rejoice (continues Sister <persName type="surname">Loskiel</persName>), at the happy   
                <lb/>lot of my dear, now eternally bleſsed husband, 
                <lb/>whom I esteemed as a precious jewel given me for 
                <lb/>a time by our Lord. His conversation and whole 
                <lb/>department was bleſsed to me. His tenderneſs, 
                <lb/>affection &amp; patience towards me, &amp; especially his 
                <lb/>attachment to our Lord &amp; Saviour, whom he loved 
                <lb/>above all things, I shall never forget. I cannot

                <lb rend="indent"/>As he concluded his own account of his course
                <lb/>through life with observing, that he has purposely 
                <lb/>omitted the mention of many particular occurrences in 
                <lb/>which he was concerned in different places, we will 
                <lb/>also paſs them over in silence, only noticing generally, 
                <lb/>that the wish which he expreſsed on his entrance into 
                <lb/>the service of our Lord, that He might be with
                <lb/>him in every thing he undertook, has been signally 
                <lb/>granted him. He preached the death of the Lord in 
                <lb/>every place wither he was called, with a warm 
                <lb/>heart &amp; with remarkable bleſsing. Without doubt
                <lb/>he finds now that wish of his gratified, that he 
                <lb/>meets now before the throne of the Lamb many of
                <lb/>those to whom he declared the gospel with bleſsing.
                <lb rend="ident"/>In our hymn-book we have many pleasing
                <lb/>memorials of his poetical genius, which also prove
                <lb/>his heavenlymindedne[s]s, &amp; how his heart delighted 
                <lb/>to mediate on the sufferings &amp; merits of our 
                <lb/>Redeemer.
                <lb rend="indent"/>Our Lord was pleased to lay a particular bleſ-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>sing on his two principal works: “the history of the 
                <lb/>miſsion of the <orgName>United Brethren</orgName> among the Indians
                <lb/>in <placeName type="continent">N. America</placeName>”; &amp; “Something for the heart on the 
                <lb/>way to eternity”. [ The former only of these has been

                <lb/>translated into English ].
                <lb/>It was a distinguished trait of his character,
                <lb/>to “rejoice with them that do rejoice, &amp; weep with them
                <lb/>that weep”.  To assist the poor, to do good, was his
                <lb/>heart’s delight; &amp; he was often sorry, that he could
                <lb/>not do herein as much as he wished.
                <lb/>It is still to be remarked, that he was ordained
                <lb/>a deacon in <placeName type="settlement">Zeist</placeName> on the <date when="1768-05-22">22 May 1768</date>, &amp; a presbyter
                <lb/>in <placeName type="settlement">Barby</placeName> on the <date when="1775-03-19">19 March 1775</date>; &amp; before his journey
                <lb/>from <placeName type="settlement">Herrenhuth</placeName> to <placeName type="continent">America</placeName>, on the <date when="1802-03-14">14 March 1802</date>,
                <lb/>he was consecrated by B. <persName>John Fred. Reichel</persName> to be a
                <lb/>Bishop of the <orgName>Brethren’s church</orgName>.
                <lb/>As already noticed, his constellation seems to have
                <lb/>been impaired by the journey to this country. Yet he
                <lb/>entered with activity; &amp; in reliance upon the powerful
                <lb/>assistance of our dear Lord, upon the office committed
                <lb/>to him here, which in the sequel however often
                <lb/>seemed too hard for him, &amp; to depress his spirits. 
                <lb/>in the year <date when="1803">1803</date> he had the particular pleasure
                <lb/>to visit the Indian mission at <placeName><settlement>Goshen</settlement> on the <geogName type="river">Mus-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>kingum</geogName></placeName>, which was so much the more agreeable to
                <lb/>him, as through his publication of the history of the
                <lb/>mission of the brethren among them, his affection
                <lb/>for them fo was very great, &amp; they were a particular

                <lb/>object of his prayers before our Lord.
                <lb/>He visited also, to mutual satisfaction, all the
                <lb/>churches of the brethren which are under the care of
                <lb/>the <orgName>general helpers conference</orgName>; &amp; his remembrance memory among
                <lb/>them all is blessed.
                <lb/>After that, as mentioned above, he was called by
                <lb/>the <orgName>Unity’s elders conference</orgName> to <placeName type="continent">Europe</placeName>; he prepared
                <lb/>himself for the journey. But on account of the war
                <lb/>he felt no freedom to undertake it, which occasioned
                <lb/>him much concern. It was therefore encouraging to
                <lb/>him to learn towards the close of the year <date when="1811">1811</date>, that
                <lb/>he was called to be cong.n helper in <placeName type="settlement">Gnadenfrey</placeName>.
                <lb/>But in the mean time his health had much declined, 
                <lb/>he did not however give up the hope of being able
                <lb/>to make the journey, which continued to be the case
                <lb/>when on the <date when="1812-05-30">30 May 1812</date>, he received a call
                <lb/>from the <orgName>Unity’s elders conference</orgName>, to be a member
                <lb/>of the late B. <persName>Jeremy Reisler</persName>. He rejoiced, with un-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>feigned loneliness of heart, at the gracious views of
                <lb/>our Lord with him; &amp; the cong.n at <placeName type="settlement">Bethlehem</placeName>,
                <lb/>&amp; all the cong.m here, took a near share in his joy,
                <lb/>&amp; very sincerely wished that, agreeable to this

                <lb/>On account of frequent sickneſs, &amp; his weakly state
                <lb/>of body, this became however more &amp; more impro-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>bable, &amp; both he and we could at length not think
                <lb/>otherwise, than that our Lord through this call
                <lb/>would only make known that he was satisfied with
                <lb/>hios willingneſs merely to devote himself with body
                <lb/>and soul to his further service. His beloved colleagues
                <lb/>in the <orgName>Unity’s elders conference</orgName> he remembered often
                <lb/>with great feruency [frequency?] in his prayers, &amp; wished them in
                <lb/>the execution of their office in the present critical
                <lb/>times, particularly in <placeName type="continent">Europe</placeName>, that our Lord might
                <lb/>powerfully support them. He was <del>for</del> sorry for the
                <lb/>interruption of the correspondence with them through
                <lb/>the war.
                <lb/>When his weakneſs so encreased, as to prevent
                <lb/>his taking any further active share in the work of
                <lb/>the Lord, he remained instant in prayer both by
                <lb/>day &amp; night for its furtherance &amp; prosperity, and
                <lb/>especially in the <orgName>Unity of the Brethren</orgName>.
                <lb/>But his principal concern was, that he him-
                <lb type="worddiv"/>self, with reference to that happy departure out
                <lb/>of time, which he earnestly longed for, was daily,
